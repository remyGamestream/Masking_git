Go in the folder corresponding to your game (x64 for 64bits game and x86 for 32bits games) then open "bin" directory

Launch qapitrace.exe

File -> New

Choose The API you want to track, depending of the game renderer api (OpenGL, D3D9 or D3D11)

Browse to the game exe in Application

Set "Working directory" to where you want to save the image

Set arguments for the game exe if needed

Press OK, the game start
Go to the screen where the texture you want to change is located then kill the game

You now have the full trace of the renderer API calls
Go to the lasts frames and find the call named : 

---------------------------
FOR D3D11 :

"DrawIndexed"
Then right-click on the call and press "LookUp State"
A replay of the game now start, wait till the end, NEVER CLOSE THE WINDOW
When it's finish look at the right tab, choose "surfaces" and look in "Textures" if the image you want to change is present
if the texture you are looking for is present, right click on it and press "Save Image", the image is now save in the bin directory
look with paint and find the dimensions of the image (example 64x64 ,128x128 etc)
then make the image that will replace the precedent at the same dimensions, in png, RGB + Alpha channel
put both on them in a directory with name as follow:
image to replace : name_to_rpl.png
New image : name_new.png

if the texture you're looking for isn't her, look in the framebuffer if the texture is already set in the image
- if it is you have to look in precedent calls and do the sames actions as before
- if the texture is not already set, you have to look next calls and do the sames actions as before
